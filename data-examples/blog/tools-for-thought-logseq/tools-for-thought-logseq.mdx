summary: 'Personal Knowledge Management tools can help us organize information, retaining more of what we learn, and connecting ideas together.'

Each day, we consume thousands of individual points of information. Some of this information is completely novel, perhaps through the result of a google search or conversation of friends, some of it we already knew, and the rest is in between. How can we integrate all of this information into a useful format so that our learning efforts are not wasted? After all, the human brain is not a perfect recall machine, and it can feel frustrating to continuously feel knowledge slipping away.

Enter the world of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems. Often referred to as a "second brain", these systems seek to help us externalize knowledge (in all of it's forms) into a format that can stand the test of time. Furthermore, they allow for linking information together through relationships, similar to how our brains learn new concepts, to help bring new knowledge into the fold. Our brains prioritize recent events naturally. Availability bias, as outlined in "Thinking Fast and Slow" highlights how we give more weight to recent events when making decisions, especially when evaluating risk or planning for disaster. "Algortihms to Live By" also speaks about caching by the "first in first out" principle is how our brains may best retrieve information.

Logseq features time front and centre through journal pages, which many users, including myself, use as the "homepage" of the application. This means that something that happened yesterday is always a close scroll away. In addition, the recent tab means that if you keep going back to a certain day or concept, it will also stay close by.

From this journal page, pages can be created and linked directly. For example, let's say that I learned about [rallly.co](https://rallly.co) on Feb 18th, and wanted to make some notes about it. I can type `[[rallly.co]]` as a bullet point and then click through the page. Now the date page is linked, so I can always check back on the context of how the knowledge was acquired.

Another great feature of Logseq is **integration.** Currently, I use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to sync book, academic papers and article highlights into Logseq respectively. This syncing happens behind the scenes, and then if I am writing about a topic and wish to link in a thought from one of these external topics, it is only a few keystrokes away. Metadata like the book author and title are automatically included.

Lastly, there is the new **whiteboards** feature, which allows the user to be able to create a mind map. At the time of writing, this feature is in beta testing, however already feels clean and polished. Blocks (such as the Logseq_Blog_Post pictured above) are able to be added, linked, and marked up with the draw and highlight tools. Any edits that are made on the whiteboard are changed in real-time on the page itself, and vice-versa.

There are many, many additional benefits of Logseq, that I won't describe in detail but will list here for the reader to explore further.

- **Markdown** - Logseq uses markdown as it's underlying language, which means that it is easy to export and import content from other markdown based systems.
- **Open Source** - Logseq is open source, and the community is very active. There are many plugins and themes available, and the developers are very responsive to feature requests and bug reports.
- **Mobile** - Logseq has a mobile app, which is available on both iOS and Android. This means that you can take your knowledge with you wherever you go.
- **Community** - There is a very active community on the [forum](https://discuss.logseq.com/), and the developers are very responsive to feature requests and bug reports.

I invite you to try it out! As mentioned in my blog post about flipped productivity, use it however you best see fit! I hope that you find it as useful as I have.
