If there is one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm always excited to try something new. I've worked in a variety of industries, studied across disciplines, and have met some truly amazing people along the way. Currently, I work as the Curator of Informatics at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, where I help turn data into knowledge. I have a Masters degree in Public Health and work as an independent consultant in the field.

Growing up I was interested in science and technology. More important than the topics was the process of problem solving and discovery. In both disciplines there is the opportunity to share what we learn with others, and I've always enjoyed that aspect of my work.

When I'm not working, I usually have my head stuck in a book. I've listed some of my favourites on this site, and I'm a believer that one of the best ways to learn about a person is to learn about the things they like to read. I also like working on small side projects, and I've listed a few of those here as well.

Whoever, and wherever you are, I would love to learn from you. If you have a cool project or idea, let's talk!
