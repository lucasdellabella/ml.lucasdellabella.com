If there is one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm always excited to try something new. I've worked in a variety of industries, studied across disciplines, and have met some truly amazing people along the way. Currently, I work as the Curator of Informatics at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum, where I help turn data into knowledge. I have a Masters degree in Public Health and work as an independent consultant in the field.

I grew up loving to tinker with things, and never really stopped. If I were to describe what I do, I would summarize it as "using data to help solve problems for the public good". In my free time I love to read, and explore new and emerging open-source software. Currently, I am very excited to be a new member to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) and hope to explore how I can contribute to that mission.
