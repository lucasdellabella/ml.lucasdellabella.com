Hey! I'm Lucas - an ex-YC founder and bedroom hacker originally from the east coast. This is my subdomain where I'm building my ML chops top-down, project by project.

I've previously worked on:

- [Untether Labs](https://www.untetherlabs.com/) - A YC backed startup working on increasing the capacity of the US Healthcare system through better scheduling tools.
- [Safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/)'s Data Marketplace team - Helping customers find the needle in the haystack of Safegraph's data
- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com)'s 'Connect' product - A tool to help restaraunt owners market to locals inside yelp via photo & video.
