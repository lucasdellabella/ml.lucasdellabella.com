summary: 'Is there a point to reading at all if we will eventually forget the specifics of what we learned? How can we use an understanding of memory to learn more effectively and retain information for longer?'
---

I have been making reading a priority over the last half decade. Without social media, a lot of time spent waiting in lines, traveling on the buses, or at the coffee shop is reading off of my phone or iPad. This has been great (though a tad expensive), and so have switched to the local library as a way to save the cost of purchasing new non-fiction books.

This switch came with one important caveat; previously I would highlight and make notes on the e-books within my library, and those notes would sync up to [Logseq](https://www.markpitblado.me/articles/tools-for-thought-logseq) for long-term safe keeping. With library books, this isn't as automatic, and has caused me to reflect on just how often I went back to check on those notes and highlights in the first place.

More broadly, this gets at why we bother to learn anything new at all if our recollection of it is just going to fade with time. Unlike computers, we aren't perfect recall machines, and therefore reading can feel like wasting time if the benefits are ephemeral rather than permanent. While reading a great book may change how we see the world for the next week or even month, a part of me is curious in the long-term how much anything actually sticks.

The **Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard** has a [great piece](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works) about the dynamics of human memory. A lot of what is explained are things that we experience on an hour-by-hour basis. Questions like "what did I have to do today?" or "when was that party I agreed to go to?" all involve us actively seeking information that at a different time was front and center in our heads. In many ways, we wish that we could go back to the moment in time just after we first learned about the information. This can be visualized as a curve, in which our memory decays with time from the moment we first learn information to the times when it becomes difficult to retrieve it. This is formally called the ["Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

A somewhat obvious, but easy to miss, conclusion from this is that we can continuously reset the curve
by reviewing the information again. However, the curve still falls off quite sharply in the short amount
of time that immediately follows learning. Luckily, there are a few ways to combat this.

## The Test Effect

When there is a test approaching, we review information with the explicit goal of retaining it, but we may also begin to think about the context behind the information and what bits would be important enough to test on in the first place. A second component to testing is that it _forces_ us to recall, and there is [evidence](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42812-000) that smaller, more frequent tests are more effective than larger, less frequent ones. To everyone that is a huge fan of one massively weighted exam at the end of the semester, the evidence is stacked against you on this one.

For studying, this can be self-enforced by having someone else test us on recently learned material, or having software (such as flashcards) help us. If we are no longer in formal education, I usually try to use conversations as an opportunity to test my knowledge. Trying to explain a concept to someone else can force us to distill the information down to its core components, and can also help us identify gaps in our knowledge.

## Spaced Repetition

This is similar to the above, however is so important that I think it deserves its own section. Interestingly, one of the [most cited papers](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1815156116) on this topic is about Duolingo, and gives some justification to the persistent (and sometimes annoying) notifications that the app peppers users with. In addition to the paper, the authors also have a [complete website](https://learning.mpi-sws.org/memorize/) that goes into the details of the research. The gist is that the best way to retain information is to review it across multiple time points, with space in between.

I have been considering how to best implement spaced repetition, specifically for longer non-fiction books. Even if I was to re-read each book once per year, this would mean that I would be able to have about 40 books in my rotation. Another question is when to stop reviewing; would one re-read be enough, or would it be better to do it twice? Thrice? One thing that I have found helpful is to write about a book after finishing it, as I did with ["A Good Life"](https://www.markpitblado.me/articles/the-good-life-book-review). This forces both reflection and contextualization, and I had to write about the book over the course of several days, in different sittings and circumstances. In my mind, I can remember the location and context associated with writing about each section, and this in turn helps me recall information about the book itself. Perhaps I could use the articles themselves as a way to practice spaced repetition, instead of re-reading the entire book.

## The Argument Against Remembering

With all of the above being said, there is a case to be made for dismissing such an intense focus on remembering details in the first place, and instead focus on large overarching concepts (that may be able to be summarized in a sentence or two). Imagine that a friend or colleague asks about a specific method covered in a book you read two months ago, because they are hoping to replicate the same methodology in a project that they are working on. Is there ever a world in which you are confident enough to give them the details by memory alone, or are you always going to double-check with the original source? If the latter, then perhaps it is better to focus on the big picture and the context of the information, rather than the specifics.

## Wrap Up

I'm planning on going through some of the existing titles in my library before seeking out new books, and will be trying to implement some of the above strategies to see if they help. For starters, before returning e-books to the library, I am planning on copying out the highlights and notes and entering them into Logseq. Perhaps the manual effort may actually be a benefit, as I will distill down the important parts even further to save effort in typing. From there, I may write future posts about books that I have loved over the years, and use the articles on this site as a way to practice spaced repetition and also to more easily share my thoughts with friends when I mention the book in conversation. Hopefully this article has given you some insight, or incentive to reflect on your current learning workflow.
